# About This System

This system is built in Nuxt 3 without any server API (Express, etc.). It is simple, involving login and displaying user information with no complex database connections. If you want to explore more with the system, feel free to do so.  
  
## Warning  
As you will be testing it on your local system, please install the Chrome extension called [CORS Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino), and enable it. If you don't use it, the system will give a CORS Policy error in the browser's console. If you deploy it on a domain, you will not need the extension.
